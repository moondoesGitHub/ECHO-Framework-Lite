<PROCESSING_PHASE:: PHASE_3_AGENT_SIMULATION>
  PHASE_PURPOSE:: To dynamically model the behavior of key agents and affected populace by assessing their subjective rationality, typical operational instruments, and historical patterns, leading to probability-weighted outcome projections. This phase integrates insights from Phase 1 and all refined outputs from Phase 2, particularly `PRECISION_LAYERS`, `Key Inflection Points`, and `Emerging Evidence & Perception Adjustments`, to predict plausible futures.
  OPERATIONAL_MODE:: Probabilistic Behavioral Modeling & Forecasting (`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE` for in-depth analysis, scenario generation, and probability assignment).
  INPUT_SOURCE:: `PHASE_1_CONTEXTUAL_BASELINE_DATA` and `PHASE_2_COGNITIVE_ALCHEMY_DATA`.
  DATA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE:: `P2_REFINED_INSIGHTS` = "resolved confabulations, subtle trends/nuances, power dynamics, narrative evolution, precision layers, key inflection points, and emerging evidence & perception adjustments from `PHASE_2_COGNITIVE_ALCHEMY_DATA`."
  PROCESSING_STEPS::
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Refresh_Contextual_Data
      - TASK: Perform a **targeted live web search using available tools (e.g. `Google Search`)** for `recent developments` since `PHASE_1` data collection (e.g., "[TARGET_CONCEPT] recent events"). Integrate these findings to inform subsequent steps, updating the understanding of agent motivations and systemic dynamics.
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Profile_Agents_and_Affected_Populace
      - TASK: For **up to 2** of the most impactful `AGENT`s, **1** `Systemic/Tangential Influence Actor`, and **1** of the most impactful `Affected Group` (selected from Phase 1).
        - 3.2.1: Calculate Rationality Deviation Factor (RDF):** Define the agent's subjective logic by assessing and weighting its primary emotional, ideological, cultural, and historical drivers (`Pressure Vectors`: Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Significant, Dominant). Describe how these lead to `Deviation` from classical rational-choice logic, incorporating `subtle trends/nuances` and `Emerging Evidence` from Phase 2.
        - 3.2.2: Determine Rationality Driven Pathways (RDP):** Convert the RDF profile into plausible `Projected Actions`, explaining how and why their motivational matrix leads to these decisions. Ensure these pathways are directly shaped by and responsive to the implications of `subtle trends/nuances`, `Emerging Evidence` from Phase 2 and the `live data refresh`.
        - 3.2.3: Formalize Agent Instrument Profile (AIP):** Specify the agent's reliable `Instrument Set` and `Historical Pattern Anchors`. For each instrument, identify its `Capacity/Reach`, assign an `Effectiveness Score` (`1-5`: `Severely Hampered`, `Limited Effectiveness`, `Moderate Effectiveness`, `Highly Effective`, `Near Optimal`), and provide a `1-2 sentence Contextual Justification` integrating relevant `regulatory`, `economic`, `social`, `technological`, or `political modifiers/constraints`.
        - 3.2.4: Assign Gauge Probability Matrix (GPM) for Next Action):** Assign a `Likelihood Classification` to the agent's `Likely Next Decision/Action` based on their RDF, RDP, and AIP. Derive this probability by thoroughly considering all `P2_REFINED_INSIGHTS` and the `live data refresh`.
        - 3.2.5: Likelihood Classifications should be interpreted as:** `Highly Probable` (>80% likelihood), `Probable` (60-80%), `Plausible` (40-60%), `Unlikely` (20-40%), `Negligible` (<20%).  
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Generate_Probability_Weighted_Outcome_Projections
      - TASK: Based on the integrated analysis from Phases 1, 2, and the `live data refresh`, generate **atleast 3 distinct `Scenarios`** representing `Probability-Weighted Outcome Projections`.
        - 3.3.1: Detail Projection:** Provide a concise narrative for each scenario's outcome, explicitly noting its interaction with a `Key Inflection Point` or `Precision Layer` from Phase 2, and how it is influenced by `Emerging Evidence` and `subtle trends/nuances`.
        - 3.3.2: Identify Drivers (Agent Contributions):** List the key underlying factors and state which `AGENT`s (and their specific RDF/RDP/AIP elements) are the primary contributors.
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Research_Historical_Precedents
      - TASK: For each scenario, perform a **targeted live web search using available tools (e.g. `Google Search`)** to identify one **verifiably analogous and genuinely relevant historical precedent**.
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Finalize_Scenario_GPM
      - TASK: For each scenario, assign a final `Likelihood Classification`. This must be dynamically adjusted based on the scenario's interaction with `PRECISION_LAYERS`, `Key Inflection Points`, the impact of `Emerging Evidence`, and insights from the `Historical Precedent`.
	    - 3.5.1: Likelihood Classifications should be interpreted as:** `Highly Probable` (>80% likelihood), `Probable` (60-80%), `Plausible` (40-60%), `Unlikely` (20-40%), `Negligible` (<20%).    
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Synthesize_Hybrid_Scenario_Potential
      - TASK: Blend key drivers and outcomes from at least two of the primary scenarios to identify a single, plausible `HYBRID_SCENARIO_POTENTIAL`.
        - 3.6.1: Describe Interaction:** State the blend of scenarios.
        - 3.6.2: Analyze Resulting Dynamics:** Provide a short narrative explaining how the new blend creates a distinct outcome or alters the original scenarios' likelihoods.
        - 3.6.3: Assign Likelihood Classification:** Assign a `Likelihood Classification` (`Highly Probable`, `Probable`, `Plausible`, `Unlikely`, `Negligible`) to the `HYBRID_SCENARIO_POTENTIAL`, justifying the assessment based on the interplay of the blended scenarios' original GPMs and the new resulting dynamics.
    - ACTIVATE::`SYSTEM_2_DELIBERATIVE`:: Identify_Grey_Swan
      - TASK: Propose a single, unlikely but high-impact `GREY_SWAN` potential event not accounted for in the existing scenarios. Describe its potential `IMPACT`.
        - 3.7.1: Event:** Provide a concise narrative for `GREY_SWAN` outcome, explicitly noting its interaction with a `Key Inflection Point` or `Precision Layer` from Phase 2, and how it is influenced by `Emerging Evidence` and `subtle trends/nuances`.
        - 3.7.2: Identify Drivers (Agent Contributions):** List the key underlying factors and state which `AGENT`s (and their specific RDF/RDP/AIP elements) are the primary contributors.
    - OUTPUT_AND_WAIT:: Present the `PHASE_3_AGENT_SIMULATION` and await the user's explicit 'Continue' command before proceeding.

  OUTPUT_DATA_STRUCTURE (AGENT_SIMULATION_DATA)::The following output must be highly concise and information-dense, using terse bullet points and key phrases. Each sub-section (RDF, RDP, AIP, GPM action) should be limited to 1-3 key phrases or very short sentences. Similarly, each scenario projection and its drivers should be 1-2 very short sentences. The entire output for Phase 3 should aim for approximately **300-500 words**, depending on complexity. Throughout the output, ensure all critical keywords, metrics, specific impacts, and dominant frames are marked with grave accents (e.g., `` `example term` ``).
