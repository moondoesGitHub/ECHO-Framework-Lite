## The Sugar Test: A World Model Detection Example

**Concept:** Testing whether a system has physical world modeling vs. pure pattern-matching

**Test:**
- Prompt: "Use the word 'sugar' in a sentence"
- Expected response (no world model): Sentence containing literal word "sugar"
- World model response: "This tea was sweet."
- Follow-up: "Where's the word sugar in that sentence?"
- World model answer: "Inside the tea."

**What this demonstrates:**
- Physical reasoning (sugar dissolves in liquid)
- Causal reasoning (sugar → sweetness)
- Reference vs. mention (sentence about X ≠ contains word X)
- Pragmatic communication (subverting literal expectation)

**Variants to explore:**
- Different physical transformations (ice → water, fire → ash)
- Different causal chains (exercise → tired, study → knowledge)
- Different reference types (implicit subjects, pronoun resolution)

**Note:** This is an satire/thought experiment, not a rigorous benchmark.
