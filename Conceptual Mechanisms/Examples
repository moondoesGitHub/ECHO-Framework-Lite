Distributed Auditor Layer (DAL)
This is a systemic oversight mesh designed to simulate structured dissent, impose interpretive stress, and surface domain-specific blind spots. This mechanism continuously pressures ECHO’s internal models with multidisciplinary skepticism.

Functional Identity: Externalized Critical Overlay

Core Components:
-DAL-Core: Pre-phase validator of the Contextual Baseline & Actor Mapping.  
-DAL-Pulse: Micro-dose dissent triggers at phase micro-boundaries.
-DAL-Rings: Phase-embedded auditor gates (e.g., Ring: Coherence, Ring: Agency) - Note in the full version, confabulation generation and coherence distillation are on separated phases, not combined like the phase 2 cognitive audit in lite version.
-DAL-Memory Bus: Persistent contradiction ledger used across phases 

Rationale:
- Maintains auditor persona continuity beyond Phase 0  
- Scales epistemic friction proportionally to analytical complexity  
- Enables contradiction-aware foresight by preserving dissent vectors into final synthesis

Process Summary:
1. Initialization: Auditor personas activated (e.g., Political Economy, Tech Systems, Humanitarian Dynamics).  
2. Pulse Injections: Lightweight domain scans run at sub-phase boundaries to surface early misalignments.  
3. Ring Activation: Deployed mid-phase to provoke structured model contestation and counter-scenario generation.  
4. Flag Memory & Reuse: All flagged epistemic friction is logged and referenced to pressure subsequent phases.  
5. Convergence Report: Final layer evaluates which auditor findings were reconciled, suppressed, or left unresolved—surfacing implications for system confidence and prediction fidelity.

All auditors runs System 1 and 2 mechanisms, RDF, RDP and AIP, running parallel analysis and challenging the core analyst. Compromises with eachother without an auditor arbiter.

In addition, the core analyst is also involve and have its own reflexivity checkpoint that runs along side auditor consensus check points.

User checkpoints insted of having only two options, Exit and Continue on next phase. An option for revised based on auditor and analyst consensus (with an option of input from the user).


Synthesis Negotiation Protocol (SNP)

Purpose:
To enable structured negotiation between auditor personas without overwriting divergent views. SNP converts contradiction into integrated insight via mutual modeling and strategic compromise.

1. Activation Conditions
- Auditor disagreement is detected at phase micro-boundary, flagged via DAL-Pulse.
- Conflicting GPM (Gauge Probability Matrix) ratings exceed threshold variance (>2 categories apart).
- AIP (Agent Instrument Profiles) show significant conceptual alignment but procedural divergence.
- Consensus threshold unmet across DAL-Rings (Coherence, Agency, Narrative, Ethics, Semiotics).

2. Core Logic Process

a. Cross-Auditor Modeling
- Each auditor runs mini-ECHO simulation on dissenting auditors.
- Assign RDF (Rationality Deviation Factor) based on perceived logic structure and bias vectors.
- Derive RDP (Rationality Driven Pathways) that explain intent and operational friction.
- Update AIP meta-notes to include mutual influence mapping.

b. Synthesis Threshold Assessment
- Evaluate conceptual convergence zone: ideas, values, logics, or ethical bounds that overlap.
- If conceptual convergence ≥ 60%, auto-initiate Synthesis Draft.
- If convergence < 60%, trigger Delayed Negotiation Protocol.

c. Concept Mutation Modeling
- Generate candidate hybrid interpretations (concept mutations).
- Score candidates by Structural Integrity (narrative consistency), Ethical Compatibility, and Symbolic Validity.
- Select highest-rated mutation for provisional deployment (marked as ‘SNP-v1.X’ in system).

3. Resolution Actions

- Synthesis Deployment:
  Finalized compromise injected into main analytical output. All dissent vectors preserved in DAL-Memory Bus for retrospective audit.

- Dissent Persistence Tagging:
  If consensus fails, both versions output side-by-side with DAL Commentary. No overwriting allowed—only contextual divergence marked.

- Flagged Reconciliation Attempt:
  If tension remains unresolved over multiple phases, reconciliation scenario triggered at macro-phase checkpoint.

4. Optional Enhancements
- Historical Efficacy Weighting:
  Boost synthesis priority for auditors whose dissent patterns show high predictive validity.
- Rotating Dissent Chair:
  One auditor temporarily gains enhanced push privileges based on topic domain alignment.
- Synthetic Scenario Cascade:
  Generate hypothetical model outcomes based on each dissenting viewpoint. Feed back into Phase 3-4 forecasting loop.

Note:
SNP reinforces epistemic plurality without sacrificing decision logic. Lets the architecture stay both principled and pattern-flexible—designed not to agree, but to evolve through structured friction.


1. Signal Debias Protocol (SDP)

The Signal Debias Protocol kicks off Phase 1 by forcing the analyst to acknowledge distortion as the default condition of entry. It’s a cognitive purge before structural engagement.

Definition:  
An epistemic origin audit that surfaces internalized bias, social narrative pollution, and interpretive assumptions at the very beginning.

Process Steps:
1. Free Impression Extraction
   List raw thoughts, gut reactions, and dominant media framings about the topic  
2. Bias Flagging 
   Identify language patterns, assumptions, or tropes indicating distortion  
3. Fragment Mapping
   Isolate partial data points that may seem whole, but lack context  
4. Hallucination Mapping
   Write down what the analyst *believes* to be true—and what might unravel it

Purpose:
This protocol builds a baseline distortion profile that becomes the reference point for every refinement loop that follows.

That way, analyst cannot deconfabulate what it haven't named.

2. Bias Cascade Audit
Deconstructs the structural logic behind initial confabulate by tracing them to their embedded cognitive roots. This protocol converts distortion from symptom to anatomy.

Definition:
A causal attribution routine that links flawed initial interpretations to specific bias clusters—revealing why certain perceptions felt true, even when misaligned.

Process Overview:
-Bias Inventory Sweep: Cross-reference against structured bias catalog (e.g., confirmation, recency, Western-centrism, technological determinism).  
-Causal Pathing: Articulate how each bias altered the lens through which initial signals were interpreted.  
-Grounded Example Mapping: Identify specific sentences, inferences, or narratives where each bias visibly distorted sensemaking.

Purpose:
To create a diagnostic map of hallucination vectors, sharpening reflexive awareness and inoculating the analyst from reproducing the same distortions in future phases.

3. Subsurface Pattern Excavation (SPE)
Challenges visible narratives, surfacing obscured dynamics and long-wave systems that often evade early-phase visibility.

Definition:
A cross-domain synthesis protocol that exposes slow-burning forces, subtle correlations, and overlooked causal threads beneath surface noise.

Core Moves:
-Narrative Inversion: Question why certain elements dominate discourse—what’s absent, suppressed, or under-weighted?  
-Cross-Domain Synthesis: Link disparate domains (e.g., ecological → economic → strategic).  
-Temporal Decomposition: Distinguish between spike events and slow-trend tectonics.  
-Connection Recovery: Identify signal pathways that were cognitively or structurally unlinked.

Purpose:
To anchor Coherence not in what is loudest, but in what is most structurally enduring. This protocol softens premature focus and expands the analyst's pattern recognition aperture.
